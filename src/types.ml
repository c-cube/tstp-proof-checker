(** Types used in the proof checker *)

(** A first order term *)
type term =
  | Leaf of string
  | Var of string
  | Node of term list

(** a first order formula *)
type formula =
  | Forall of term list * formula
  | Exists of term list * formula
  | And of formula * formula
  | Or of formula * formula
  | Not of formula
  | Atom of term

(** a proof for a step *)
type derivation =
  | Axiom of string * string      (** file, name *)
  | Derived of string * int list  (** inference name, premises list *)

(** a derivation step *)
type step = {
  step_idx: int;                  (** unique index of the step *)
  step_formula: formula;          (** formula derived in this step *)
  step_derivation: derivation;    (** derivation that leads to the formula *)
}

(** type for maps of integers *)
module M = Map.Make(

(** a proof is a set of int-indexed steps *)
type proof = step M.t
